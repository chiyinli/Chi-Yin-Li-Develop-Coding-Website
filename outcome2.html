        <h2>2.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h2><br><br>

        I wanted the layout to be pleasing to the eyes. Make sure titles and headings are centralised. Also that they have just one font and size. Colours are not garish or they clashes. Use just one font and one size for the main body of text. Maybe one image for the website.<br><br>

        <h2>2.2 - Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
	
        Copyright protection is there to protect people's intellectual property, designs, work and ideas. Sometimes it’s just easier to copy images and text from other people's website to be used in your own. 

        Unless you have permission from the original author, there might be a fee to use other people’s work.<br><br>Sometimes, they might just be a refusal for any work or images to be used.

        There are certain images online that are royalty free, which means there are no copyright ownerships.But other people’s written work might be a different situation. Under best practices, it isn't a good idea just to copy text from a website. This is called plagiarism, copyright infringement.<br><br>This is copy someone else's work as your own without any consent from the original author.

        Sometimes, authors don’t need a fee. They might just need an acknowledgment of their work to be mentioned. So best practice is to mention as a form of reference. But this still need a written consent from the author. Images with a copyright will have a  watermark superimposed on the image to state who owns it.<br><br>Strict fines can be imposed to those who don't follow these rules. Prison sentence up to 6 months or fines of £50,000.<br><br>

        <h2>2.3 -  Describing access issues that need taking into account</h2>

        People with any disabilities may need access to websites to access help. So they can make use of Information from the internet, your website may need certain features to allow them to use it.<br><br>

        People who are blind or partially sighted may need to have text read out to them. They may also need to have text optimised by a large text displayed or have access to the magnifier feature to be used on the text. They might even have a braille reader installed. Your system may need to accommodate for this.<br><br>

        People who are deaf or hard of hearing may not be able to read text. They might only be taught sign language. They may need transcripts or captions of text for videos being shown.<br><br>

        People with motor disabilities, for example muscle controls or missing limbs; may need use of a head mouse or mouth mouse.They may need a keyboard with keys that matches their range of movement.<br><br>

        <h2>2.4 - Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites</h2>

            The first file type for a website must be named index with a file extension of html. This is the first page for a website. However, other pages can be any names you care to name them. This is to tell the web browser how to decrypt the code for the website.<br><br>

            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are files that define styles of your website. From Fonts, Font Sizes, Page Layouts and Colour.<br><br>

            JPEG Files are image files. These files have compression in built to allow faster access to the image.<br><br>

            MIDI Files are music or sound files that allow sounds to be heard on your website.<br><br>

            MP3 are other types of music files. This type of files has compression as well to allow faster access and for the file to not take up too much memory space on the system.<br><br>

            PDF (Portable Document Files) are files to be viewed on various devices or platforms and they still look the same regardless.<br><br>
