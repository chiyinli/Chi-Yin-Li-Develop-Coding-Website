        <h2 class="color">1.0 - About Me - Chi Yin Li</h2><br><br>
        
            I have always been interested in IT. From Coding, Networking, System Builds, Gaming and Security. This started from school with the very first computer, a Commodore VIC-20. This computer was a 8-bit machine. It only has 5K of memory. It was named after the sound chip. <br><br> The school taught BASIC (Beginners All Symbolic Introductory Code) programming.
        
            Later, I was totally into computer programming. I taught myself everything about BASIC programming, then later on Assembly Language (Machine Language).<br><br> We have owned various systems during the 8-bit era. From Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum 48K, Oric Atmos 48K, Dragon 32K, Atari 400XL. Then when technology arrived to 16-bit, we owned an Atari ST.<br><br>
        
            Recently, I have studied CCNA (Certified Cisco Network Academy), which is IT Networking. I learnt about Encapsulating Data, Routering, IP Addresses, Subnets, OSI 7 Layer Model to name a few. Also Cisco PC IT Essentials, which is PC Repairs and System Builds. With this course I have learnt how to repair and build my own PC Systems. I can build a Desktop PC within a specification and then install the Operating System. Configure the system and then test it. All the time to make sure safety is maintained, both for myself and the system.<br><br>
        
            Eventually this journey took me to Code Nation in Manchester. I wanted to learn all about Cyber Security. So I signed up to their Master Cyber Course. This was a broad subject. We learnt all about NIST, GDPR, CIA Triad, Pentesting, Blue Team, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, Hack the Box, Attack & Defense Labs, CTF Learn and Over the Wire.
        
            I continued my personal development with Python, HTML (Hyper-Text Mark-Up Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and Java Script Coding in Code Nation. This was done in their Three Week Coding Development Course.<br><br>
        
            In my spare time I like to program Aduino Projects and also Raspberry Pi's. Making small robot that require their own programming language to do certain tasks.<br><br>

        <h2>1.1 - Describing The Purpose Of IT In Modern Business</h2><br><br>

            Information technology is now increasing important and popular in all modern business. It helps businesses to be more productive, increase its performance, streamline communications, help businesses expand globally to all over the world. It also improves customer experience with the company.<br><br>

            Customers can now gain information about a company anytime of the day or night. They can find out what time a company opens and closes. What they sell or what services they provide? Where they are located? When they are busy?  Or when they aren’t busy? They can include other information like company emails. Their telephone for local office or for a global office. Or for other departments.<br><br>
 
            They can use technology to provide information about their inventory. What stock they are holding? What items need to be ordered or restocked. This will improve it immensely. Less waste. Eliminate overstocking. Make sure when stock is about to expire on the date for food.<br><br>

            Companies can now increase security to the premises using Information Technology. By using web cameras, connected alarms, connected doorbells and connected fire and flood alarms. Information from these devices can be forwarded to mobile devices incase of a break in or a fire, explosion or flood. Security Personnel of the business can be notified immediately. Without Information technology these services are not possible.<br><br>

            Forest are being used less for the modern paperless office. Companies are now using cloud services with Amazon AWS, Google Web Services and Microsoft Azure to store all their data. Less wasted paper. Less wasted office space. No more wasted space for filing cabinets. These services are offsite. Less power is consumed. Helping the company to be more greener and environmentally friendly. Data can be retrieved anywhere in the world using these services.

            They can now easily expand their business to another country. Just by setting up another language so they can host their website in another country.

            Businesses can now be operated anywhere in the world. Cutting out commuting time for staff to the company. Certain business operations can be done anywhere as long as there is an internet signal. This in turn will cut out commuting time in a vehicle.<br><br>

        <h2 class="color">1.2 - Describing Methods, Skills and Resources Needed to Complete Digital Projects Successfully.</h2><br><br>

            To complete any digital project successfully, there must be a collaboration between all members of the team. To share the updated code and other information.
    
            To achieve this all members of the team must agree to which version of code to write the program in. To agree to which forum to post any code to. They must complete a To Do List.<br><br> They must also before writing any code at all, complete a Flow Chart. The Flow Chart must flow from the top of the project page to the bottom of the project page. The continuation of the code from any input must flow from top to bottom of the chart until all the code is terminated.
    
            Team members must agree on what role they are to be signed to. There may be a team leader assigned.<br><br> All this must be done first before any code is written. They must agree to what parameters the program will operate. What is its function? What does the program do? What device will it run on? Do you need it to be cross platform to run on different computers or mobile devices?<br><br>
    
            To make sure this is done successfully, a Trello Board is recommended. A Trello Board is a To Do List. It has three main areas; To Do, Doing and then Done. Each member of the team should be assigned a certain task to complete the project. There should also a member of the team to maintain the Trello Board as each task is being done and completed.
    
            To help me complete this project, I have done a Trello Board as follows;<br><br>
    
            <a href="https://trello.com/b/Ej6TwcJA/chi-yin-li-trello-board">Trello Board Link</a><br><br>
    
            Flow chart can be done via www.draw.io as follows when we done our program;<br><br>
    
            <a href="https://www.draw.io/#G1wubcrA6kE3ytrBlCSOcEEmL3AJT-PyB1">Flow Chart Link</a><br><br>

</div>
<div>

    <p>
        <h2>1.3 - Plan and Carry Out Tasks Using IT</h2><br><br>

            I plan to use VS Code to program the website. To make sure all aspect of the project is done, I'll use a Trello Board to manage it. Afterwards I plan on uploading to GitHub and making available to the public. Using VS Code with HTML and CSS file makes the website easy to make.<br><br> 
    
            You can insert pictures, text contents, website links on Google Site. You change Themes, Fonts, Font Size, Colour and Layout.<br><br>
    
            To make sure the website blog is complete, a Trello Board is recommended Trello Board is an Online To Do List . Each Trello Board will have To Do, Doing and Done.<br><br>
    
            This will make sure all aspects of the website is done. Nothing is missing. All research is listed.<br><br>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        <h2>1.4 - Describe the Risks That Might Impact Digital Projects – What Causes Digital Projects to Fail?</h2><br><br>

            Miscommunication is the biggest factor that causes digital projects to fail. From initial outline parameters, to Flow Charts, Trello Board and all Coding Aspects.<br><br>Everything must be agreed on meticulously. Every team member must know their role. Blocks of codes must not be misplaced or not saved.
    
            The digital project must be completed on an agreed time. Any extension must be agreed on before the deadline.<br><br>
    
            It must not exceed the agreed upon budget. It works as designed, without any bugs. It meets the set out goals to its use. Also it will work on the agreed upon platform. Members of the public will continue to use it. For this, there must be continued support from the software developers to address any issues during software testing through to general public release. Program patches will need to be issued regularly.
    
            Last be not least, the company who issued the funding for the software are happy with the end product.<br><br>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        <h2>1.5 - Describe How You Would Go About Selecting and Using IT Systems and Software.</h2><br><br>

            Before any coding is being done, the type of IT systems and software must be chosen first. What devices is chosen must be researched? Whether the device can support the code? Whether the code can run on the device? Whether the device can run the code without bottlenecking?<br><br>
    
            During our software development we were using an Intel Core i5 1.8GHz 64-bit with 8 Giga-Bytes of memory laptop. This computer also had a 128 Giga-Bytes of Solid State Disk Drive to store the coding as it is written. This system is more than capable for our use and need. This system is using Windows 10 64-bit. It has been fully updated.<br><br>
    
            Also we need to decide which coding language to use. Whether the developing software can run on the device? Make sure you have the updated version? What kind of application you are designing? Can this coding language support this application? Is it hard or easy to update the code you are developing and role it out to the end user. Is it easy for the end user to update the program from the updates?<br><br>
    
            For our project we had to program a text based adventure. We decided to code it in Python using Python IDLE. Python IDLE is a coding developing tools. This is a simple tool to use. You can easily see the code being written. You can easily run the code from IDLE, this will open a new window as the code is being executed. 
    
            This feature will make the code really simple to bug hunt and sort out any syntax errors. Several versions can be written at the same time and saved. This is a best practice. When you update the code, it is a best practice not to delete the older version until the finish version is ready for testing by other users or to be released.<br><br>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        <h2>1.6 - Describe and Provide Analysis on How Your Chosen Technologies Have Helped You Achieve Your Outcomes.</h2><br><br>

        To make sure all outcome is addressed during all stages of software development, a Project Management System must be implemented.<br><br>This can be physical or digital based. These are called a Kanban System. Kanban is derived from Japanese meaning cards you can see.
    
        This is a To Do Board.<br><br>There are ideally three sections on the board; To Do, Doing and Done. This is used to make sure all aspects of software development  is done, in the right order and done by the right people using the right tools and research. 
    
        Also there is a need for a forum to allow code sharing to be done. We used Slack Code Sharing Channel for this. But during professional code development it is common practice to use GitHub. This is a forum to allow Coders to share their code to other Coders. This may help other coders to problem solve their coding needs. There are tools to help coders to find the right blocks of code from GitHub. This can be done automatically. It can then be reviewed before being used.<br><br>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        <h2>1.7 - Describe Legal Guidelines and Constraints That Impact Digital Projects</h2><br><br>

        General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) governs the use of people's information in digital format. How is it stored? How it is access? The availability of the data? What information is stored? They govern procedures and protocols on security to the data. It gives people the right to opt in or out on their information to be used and retained. It helps to impose heavy fines if the procedures are not implemented.<br><br>

        Businesses storing people’s data must protect it. If the business has a data breach they must report it within 72 hours. They don’t need to inform the nature of the breach straight away, but they must keep GDPR informed. <br><br>

        If these protocols and procedures are not met and followed, businesses can be fined either 2% of their annual income or 10 million euros or 4% or 20 million euros. So companies must test their network infractures and servers for any vulnerabilities. They must fix them and make sure it is safe for everybody to use.<br><br>

        
    <p>

<div>
    <p>
        <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed</h2><br><br>

        During the course to develop our own website we used various tools to aid this. We used Trello Development Board and Develop the Code using Visual Studio Code Development Tool.<br><br>

        Visual Studio Code is a very powerful tool. Not only can you use HTML (Hyper-Text Mark-Up Language), but a number of other languages. These include;<br><br>

        CSS (Cascading Style Sheet), C, C++, C#, Python, Java, Java Script, PHP (General Purpose Programming Language), Ruby.<br><br>

        There are much more supported. This made this tool more than adequate for the job. I was extremely pleased with this. It made the development of the code really easy. It will highlight the proper syntax as you are writing it. I will also highlight any error with an underscore line under the particular code that isn’t right. It can highlight what colours are available. Using the proper name of the colour or using a HEX code. Or you can select from a colour palette. Just point the cursor and select the required colour.<br><br>

        We also needed a Kanban Board. We achieved this using a Trello Board. A Kanban Board is a list of To Do. This will have subsections from To Do, Doing and then Done. You can customise this board using colours to achieve various tasks together for easier visual.<br><br>

        This tool makes the project easier to complete. Nothing can be missing from the project.<br><br>

        This tool is really useful. Very pleasing to the eye. Easy to use. I am really happy to use it. I will be using it in the future.<br><br>

    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        <h2>2.2 - Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h2><br><br>

        The Trello Board and VS Code tools we used were appropriate and adequate for the job. These tools made the website very easy to develop.<br><br>

        The Trello Board with it’s colour coded cards, easy user interface and easy pop up menu made the project a joy to develop.<br><br>

        VS Code Tool Kit is extremely easy to use and very powerful. Support a large library of programming languages. It will highlight syntax errors, spelling errors to the code and highlight various options during development. From colours, structure to the pages, layout, links, images, sounds and fonts.<br><br>

        For our website, several pages to the website can be developed at the same time. The CSS code can be developed written during the same time. This will allow various structure and conformity to be written into the code.<br><br>

    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h2><br><br>

        Overall, I’m happy with my website. As long as the title is larger and centralised, links can be clicked to the other pages and colours are easy to the eyes. Text can be read easily.<br><br>

        This still leaves room for more improvements. Animations, various GIFs throughout the website, borders and boxes to focus the eyes better to the text was considered. Different size fonts for different areas of text. Different colours for different areas of the website. Text and images to fade in and out. This requires more coding using CSS and HTML header.<br><br>

    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2><br><br>

        Interactions were considered to be incorporated into the website. Apart from just clicking onto which page you will like to see.<br><br>

        The site can ask questions on what you would like to see and read and then expand the experience with other contents. These contents can be links or videos from the internet. The user may have a particular interest for example with the VS Code or Trello Board. It can include links to the websites linking them to those interest only if  they answered that they wanted more knowledge to the subject.<br><br> 

        It can have background on educationally lessons to use those tools. It can be more in depth if they wanted to. It can bring up a broad knowledge of the subject at first and then ask if they wanted more. <br><br>

        This will give users a better understanding on website, how they are written and built. Some people who use website have no or very limited knowledge on how to write a website. Others may use tools as a shortcut to design their website, for example using Google Sites. This site has all the tools necessary to design the website from the ground up without any knowledge of coding.<br><br> 

    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        <h2>2.5 - Review Outcomes to Make Sure They Match Requirements and are Fit for Purpose</h2>

        During this review on my website, I think at this early stage its matches my requirements and it is for a purpose.<br><br>

        To get across as much information to any user, a broad sense of the topic. To make it easy on the eye, not too many distractions on the website. The colour has an easy contrast to the eyes. Not too harsh on vision.<br><br>

        The purpose of the website is to showcase what I have learnt on the course. To have a better understanding on website coding. To make sure policies and procedures are followed during software development in a commercial scenario with others in the team. These must be met, outlined and understood from the very beginning.<br><br> 

    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        <h2>3.1 Review the Benefits and Drawbacks of IT Tools and Systems Used in Terms of Productivity and Efficiency</h2>

        In terms of efficiency to software development, within a team would make efficient and productivity a better choice. Someone can research certain code syntax to review and to be incorporated in the final product. Someone can at the same time research other features can be inserted into a website and how to write it. Someone can research other types of layouts or fonts. They can surf the internet to other websites to get a wider idea on designs.<br><br>

        Another person can find images to download, royalty free, to be used into the site. Someone maybe can design an image and then several images thereafter, to be used for animation purposes. This will make the website more engaging and hold onto a user interest further. Or even design a logo for the website.<br><br>

        Maybe someone can research colour choices. To make sure no two colours clash with each other, one for text and another for background. If colours used are too garish, users will not stay on the website for too long. Counter productive to its use.<br><br>

        Obviously, towards the end of the initial code production, the website has to be tested post production before public testing. This will need a dedicated team to make sure there isn’t any errors. All link clicks to the right page. There isn’t any spelling mistakes. That all images used are royalty free. If they aren’t then make sure that all due diligent are met beforehand.<br><br>

    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        <h2>3.2 - Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2><br><br>

        Most software languages now have coding templates or cookbooks. Ideas that can be easily rewritten to fit its purpose. This can be stored in a repository, a coding repository that can retried when needed in future. In Python, tools or templates can be imported and used fit for its purpose.<br><br>

        For these templates there has to be remarks written in the code to remind other users of its use. This is to make sure there isn’t any mistakes during its use.<br><br>

        The best practice is to make sure before any coding is done beforehand, that designs, it’s use, what language, what platform, what fonts, layout and colours are discussed. If you are working in a team, who is doing what task is assigned before any work is carried out.<br><br>

    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h2><br><br>

        Team work is always best solutions for any IT projects. Especially large IT projects for big clients. As long as each team member knows their role. So there isn’t any overlap in the project.<br><br>

        It will be counter productive if certain codes are written to do the same thing by two or more people. So a coding repository is recommended like Slack or GitHub. They must upload the code they are working on and give a brief description of its use.<br><br>

        During software development, every team member must be briefed before, during and post operations. Each member of the team must in turn brief others during their time with the project. They must inform others of errors they encounter. If the code isn’t doing what it should. If there a more efficient way to execute a block of code to do one feature.<br><br>

    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2><br><br>

        In house post production testing will always be done to any software before it is released to public testing. This is to ensure QA (Quality Assurance) on the software.

        Basic functionality are tested to make sure the software or website does what it says it does. This will then move on to coding review. A fresh pair of eyes can make all the difference. Other people may have an input on how to improve the code. Maybe to save on memory they can write a piece of code that is shorter so it takes up less space.<br><br>

        Afterwards, a static code review testing can be done. This test is done by a tool that will look at the code and compare it. It can look for weakness in the code, if there is a better piece of code that can replace it. It can also look for vulnerabilities in security for the code.<br><br>

        The software can also be broken down into blocks of code to be tested. These are called unit testing. Each tester will have a simulation to test the block of code independently.<br><br>

        After all this, they can release it to a single user performance testing. One person will be assigned to test the software or website as a whole. To make sure there isn’t any errors. It does everything it claims to do. Only after all this testing can the software or website will be released to a public testing panel.<br><br>
